# ✅ Java-ToDo-Swing-GUI

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **To-Do List desktop application** built using **Java Swing**.  
It provides a simple and clean interface where you can **➕ add tasks, ❌ delete tasks, and 📝 manage multi-line task descriptions**.  
The app also shows a 📭 *placeholder message* when no tasks are available, making it **user-friendly and minimalistic**.  
## 🤔 Why I Built This  
I built this project as a hands-on way to strengthen my **Java GUI development skills 💻**.  
Working with Swing helped me understand ⚡ **event-driven programming**, 🎨 **UI rendering**, and 🏗️ **building real-world desktop applications**.  
It also gave me experience with concepts like:  
- 🎭 **Custom cell rendering**  
- 🪄 **Handling empty states**  
- ✅ **User input validation**  
## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- ☕ **Java Programming** – core language used to implement logic.  
- 🖼️ **Swing (GUI Toolkit)** – created the user interface (`JFrame`, `JList`, `JTextArea`, `JButton`, `JScrollPane`).  
- 🎛️ **Event Handling** – implemented `ActionListener` for button clicks and list management.  
- 🎨 **Custom Rendering** – developed a renderer for multi-line task display with separators.  
- 🗂️ **Model-View Design** – tasks stored in a `DefaultListModel`, separating data and UI.  
🚀 **Future Enhancements**:  
- 💾 Saving and loading tasks from a file or database. 
- 🎨 Improving the UI design with colors, fonts, and themes.
